# What do I do ? 
I am currently a DevOps engineer. I work on hosting and delivering DevOps tools to a community of Developers, among them Github self-hosted, Artifactory, Jira ...
I also code small utilities in Python, occasionaly in Terraform and SaltStack. I try to get myself to Ansible but I really love Salt :p
